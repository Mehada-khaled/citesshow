        (Arabic: قلعة صلاح الدين, romanized: Qalaʿat Salāḥ ad-Dīn)
        is a medieval Islamic-era fortification in Cairo, Egypt, built by Salah ad-Din (Saladin)
        and further developed by subsequent Egyptian rulers. It was the seat of government in Egypt
        and the residence of its rulers for nearly 700 years from the 13th to the 19th centuries.
        Its location on a promontory of the Mokattam hills near the center of Cairo commands a strategic
        position overlooking the city and dominating its skyline.
        At the time of its construction, it was among
        the most impressive and ambitious military fortification
        projects of its time.[1] It is now a preserved historic site, including mosques and museums.</string>
    <string name="egyptiannusuemdesc">The Egyptian Museum of Antiquities contains many important pieces of ancient Egyptian history. It houses the world\'s largest collection of Pharaonic antiquities. The Egyptian government established the museum built in 1835 near the Ezbekieh Garden and later moved to the Cairo Citadel. In 1855, Archduke Maximilian of Austria was given all of the artifacts by the Egyptian government; these are now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.

A new museum was established at Boulaq in 1858 in a former warehouse, following the foundation of the new Antiquities Department under the direction of Auguste Mariette. The building lay on the bank of the Nile River, and in 1878 it suffered significant damage owing to the flooding of the Nile River. In 1891, the collections were moved to a former royal palace, in the Giza district of Cairo.[1] They remained there until 1902 when they were moved again to the current museum in Tahrir Square, built by the Italian company of Giuseppe Garozzo and Francesco Zaffrani to a design by the French architect Marcel Dourgnon.[2]

In 2004, the museum appointed Wafaa El Saddik as the first female director general</string>

        and to see some frankly mind-blowing medieval Islamic architecture and art. And not in a stuffy, museum-type behind-the-glass environment
        -- it’s a free pedestrian street with the architecture all around you, so you don’t have to worry about paying money to stare at super curated things that you a) don’t really understand, and b)
        are kind of boring. One thing we can promise about Moez Street -- it is not boring, that’s for sure.

Basic things, such as lack of knowledge, understanding and care, have resulted in many animals dying. Those that remain are  unhappy and malnourished.

El Nada Land has started to build new enclosures for some of the animals, but it is a slow process and the animals are being neglected ie Food, cleaning the current inappropriate enclosures and water- The basic essentials for life.

I care about all of the animals, but in particular, I have gained a respect and love, for Robbie, the Patas monkey, that lives
alone. Despite her horrid life, she is the most dignified lady and the main attraction of this place.

I visit weekly, sometimes more, but every time I visit, I struggle emotionally, it breaks my heart, to see animals so unhappy.
At this stage of the rebuilding, the current animal organisations that exist in Egypt, should be working with El Nada Land, to ensure all is correct and built to a standard, thus providing the very best for these poor creatures.

    <string name="vallyofkingdesc">The Valley of the Kings (Arabic: وادي الملوك Wādī al-Mulūk; Coptic: ϫⲏⲙⲉ, romanized: džēme[1] Late Coptic: [ˈʃɪ.mæ]), also known as the Valley of the Gates of the Kings (Arabic: وادي أبواب الملوك Wādī Abwāb al-Mulūk),[2] is a valley in Egypt where, for a period of nearly 500 years from the 16th to 11th century BC, rock-cut tombs were excavated for the pharaohs and powerful nobles of the New Kingdom (the Eighteenth to the Twentieth Dynasties of Ancient Egypt).[3][4]
The valley stands on the west bank of the Nile opposite Thebes (modern Luxor), within the heart of the Theban Necropolis.[5] The wadi consists of two valleys: the East Valley (where the majority of the royal tombs are situated) and the West Valley (Valley of the Monkeys).[6][7]

    <string name="vallyofqueendesc">The Valley of the Queens (Arabic: وادي الملكات Wādī al Malekāt) is a site in Egypt, where the wives of pharaohs were buried in ancient times. It was known then as Ta-Set-Neferu, meaning "the place of beauty". It was most famous for being the burial site of many wives of Pharaohs.[1] Pharaohs themselves were buried in the Valley of the Kings.[2]
Using the limits described by Christian Leblanc, the Valley of the Queens consists of the main wadi, which contains most of the tombs, along with the Valley of Prince Ahmose, the Valley of the Rope, the Valley of the Three Pits, and the Valley of the Dolmen. The main wadi contains 91 tombs and the subsidiary valleys add another 19 tombs. The burials in the subsidiary valleys all date to the 18th Dynasty.[3]
The reason for choosing the Valley of the Queens as a burial site is not known. The close proximity to the workers village of Deir el-Medina and the Valley of the Kings may have been a factor. Another consideration could have been the existence of a sacred grotto dedicated to Hathor at the entrance of the Valley. This grotto may have been associated with rejuvenation of the dead.[3]

    <string name="luxortempledesc">The Luxor Temple (Arabic: معبد الأقصر) is a large Ancient Egyptian temple complex located on the east bank of the Nile River in the city today known as Luxor (ancient Thebes) and was constructed approximately 1400 BCE. In the Egyptian language it was known as ipet resyt, "the southern sanctuary". It was one of the two primary temples on the east bank, the other being Karnak.[1] Unlike the other temples in Thebes, Luxor temple is not dedicated to a cult god or a deified version of the pharaoh in death. Instead, Luxor temple is dedicated to the rejuvenation of kingship; it may have been where many of the pharaohs of Egypt were crowned in reality or conceptually (as in the case of Alexander the Great, who claimed he was crowned at Luxor but may never have traveled south of Memphis, near modern Cairo).</string>
